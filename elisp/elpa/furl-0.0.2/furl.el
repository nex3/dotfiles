;;; furl.el --- Friendly URL retrieval

;; Copyright (C) 2010 Google Inc.

;; Author: Nathan Weizenbaum <nweiz@google.com>
;; Version: 0.0.2

;;; Commentary:

;; furl.el is a friendlier layer on top of url.el. It makes the most common use
;; cases (sending parameters and receiving a string response) easier, at the
;; expense of making less common use cases (non-default error handling, reading
;; response headers) somewhat more complex.

;; One simplification furl.el makes is not using cbargs parameters for
;; asynchronous functions. These are omitted because `lexical-let' from cl.el
;; can accomplish the same purpose when necessary.
